#Partch note 3/5/2021 :

Note : Im working on compiling my game engine on an jar and make a dll for using java in unity like i have seee on a random forum the last day. I working also on the intro im gona create some assets and exporting an fbx file of my logo and the scene for the intro is created and here ( is this scene contain only a basic vr rig witchout hands is an intro where you not need to interact with object is just visual ) i have also make a main sceen and im gowing to use this as a test scene for making the moving rig script with a cool animation and an option for chosee the locomotion system the user want to use. I have also make realy basic hands ( you can chekk the hands prefab ont the prefab folder and im gowing to try to make intereactable things not only with the grip and maybe write my own script for monitoring and biding it to other acction ) i need to make new hands also but that okay im gowing later. I have also an idea for how im gona try to make the OVR support cause nto everyone have a occulus headset and i need probabely for like 80% of my friend make an OVR version for playing it with my friends X) but i think i neeed to change the unity version cause i have try to add the ovr eexperimental script thing to this game but i can't so maybe im gona change for an other version of unity.
